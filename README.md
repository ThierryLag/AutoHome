# PHP cli for Home Automation (with NHC)

> **Warning WIP !** Use it at you own risk.

This PHP script must be call by cron job every minutes.
You can define actions in `datas/timeline.php` and, 
if the time match, the action will be execute.

You can implement various plugin for the actions, 
but my goal (for this project) is to use it with Smart Home and IoT.
